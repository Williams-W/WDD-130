    <h1>Left Bath</h1>
    <h5>I know that everyone hates cleaning the bathrooms. The stains never come out, there is gross hair, and depending on your roomates, 
        urine or worse splattered down the sides of the toilet and possibly walls. Bathrooms are not hard.
    </h5>
    <h5>For the toilet be sure to use a toilet cleaner and a brush. Most people forget to clean the deeper parts of the inside of the toilet.
        Ask your apartment complex if they a pumice stone that you can borrow to complete the task. This polishes the inside of the toilet and 
        removes any hard water rings that have built up. 
    </h5>
    <h5>
        Don't use toilet cleaner in the shower. I feel like an idiot for having to tell people this but it doesn't work. Bleach is also your worst 
        nightmare. Never and I mean never use bleach in a shower. The floor eventually disinegrates and I have seem shower heads vaporize. 
        I reccommend using Kaboom or Clorox Bathroom Cleaner to remove those hard stains. Then use a gentle scrubbing pad (NOT STEEL WOOL) and gently 
        scrub the surfaces.
