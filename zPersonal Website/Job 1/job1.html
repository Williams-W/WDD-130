    <h1>Sink and Fridges</h1>

    <div id="text-main">

        <h5>Prepare:</h5>
        
        <ul>
            This job is super important for residents who are moving in. The last thing they want to find is
            some liquified asparagus in the bottom draw of their fridge when they move in. Plan ahead before the semester ends. I have seen 
            many residents throw away unopened bags of frozen chicken because they can't take them on the plane with them. When you get close to 
            the end of the semester look at what food you have. Plan your meals accordingly. 
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Cleaning the fridge and sink requires some really cheap cleaners. I reccommend buying white vinegar 
            and some dish soap. For the fridge you need a rag and the sink can use a rag or a soft non-scratching cleaning pad. 
            (Do not use stainless steel or copper on the sink!)
        </ul>

        <h5>Coordinate:</h5>
        
            <ul>
                This job requires some coordination between you and your 
                roommates. Talk to them and find out what food needs to be thrown away.
                It can be frustrating when you go to make food and discover that the fridge has been wiped clean.
                ASK BEFORE YOU THROW AWAY!
            </ul>
            
            <ul>
                The same amount of coordination is required for the sink. You are not responislbe to clean your roommates dishes!
                Give them plenty of warning to clear out the sink and empty the drying rack. That is their responisibilty!
                If your roommate does not take care of them, gently place them in trash bags and inform them that they will be thrown out
                before clean checks happen. 
            </ul>

        <h5>Cleaning Tips and Making it Fun</h5>
            <ul>
                Don't forget to dance, sing and have fun.     
            </ul>               
            <ul>
                Be sure to wipe down the inside walls of the fridge. 
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Clear off and wipe all dust off the top of the fridge.
            </ul> 
            <ul>
                Check the seal that goes around the doors. 
            </ul>
