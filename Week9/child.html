            <h5>Dry Oar was founded in 1872 by Sir Water Floatington and his 14 children. Sir Floatington and his family had followed the Oregon trail 
                several years earlier and built their first cabin on the banks of the Bear Creek River. The area was infested by bears, but that didn't stop
                the Floatington family from building their first canoe and testing the adventurous waters. Unfortunately, only three children survived the journey.
                These orphaned children did not learn from the mistakes of their father or other siblings and continued to build prototype rafts. They used
                beavers as test dummies and eventually developed an oar that never got wet on the rapids. Today, we continue to handmake these dry oars to
                provide as many people as possible the chance to float these beautiful rapids.
