      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I'm a senior in business analytics and I work a lot with data. 
        One of the biggest problems I face with data is finding efficient and accurate methods to gather data. 
        I work for a property management company and oversee the white glove process at several complexes. 
        One of the biggest hassles of white gloves is the paperwork. 
        There is so much data that needs to be collected each semester! 
        I'm overwhelmed by the several stacks of paper when I am done. 
        That is why I want to build a website that can help automate this process and create organized data for me. 
        I have been learning to include text boxes and drop-down menus in HTML. 
        The only challenge that I see is incorporating a simple javascript code to submit the data, but 
        I have already found some premade code for that.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>As an assistant manager for white gloves, I print out too much paper every semester for white gloves. I am hoping that students

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Here students will learn about white glove procedures. This includes assigning jobs, filling out your cleaning packet,
        schdeuling a time to check out, and leaving the apartment. There will be a layout of expectations of what they must do 
        in order to make sure that they get a full refund on their security deposit. 
        Students will also discover some tips to help make white glove easier.

        One thing that is super cool about this website is that students have no other alternative website to turn to. 
        If things go well and the property managment company I work for decides to use this then I will have created the only website
        that students can use to pass white glove. The idea of this website is to get rid of paper and digitalize the white glove process.
