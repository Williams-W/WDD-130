    <p>Three Important Tips To Pass Your White Glove</p>
    
    <div id="text-main">
        <h5>Prepare:</h5>
        <img id="rimage" src="./Images/food.jpg" alt="">
        <ul>
            <li>Don't fight 14 weeks of grime! Clean frequently throughout the semester to make white gloves less demanding. </li>
                 <h2> </h2>
            <li>Don't buy stuff you can't take with you! (The photo to the right is an example of a student who didn't plan ahead. They had to 
                leave all of this food behind.)
            </li>
                 <h2> </h2>
            <li>Buy the right cleaning products and supplies! Students fail because they improvise last minute and end up using 
                toilet cleaner in the oven. (Don't do this!) 
            </li>
                 <h2> </h2>
            <li>Start packing clothes and items you won't need a few days in advanced.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Coordinate:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk with your roommates. This makes white gloves so much easier! When are they planning on moving out? What time are they
                    going to clean? Could you share cleaning products? Can I throw this away? 
                </li>
                     <h2> </h2>
                <li>Ask: If you are cleaning out the fridge be curdious of others food. The same goes for the vanity. 
                    Don't just throw stuff away. 
                </li>
                    <h2> </h2>
                <li>Work together and be considerate. Chances are that white gloves are just as stressful for your roommates
                    as it is for you. They have other things going on and it is not worthwhile to get mad because everyone is probably on edge. 
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Make it Fun:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>As mentioned above, white gloves are stressful! Don't be afraid to crank up your music and sing your heart out. 
                    It is okay to stop and have a short dance party with your roommates to destress. Find ways to celebrate the end of a semester!
                </li>
